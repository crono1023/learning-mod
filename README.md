Learning to create Minecraft mods using MC Forge


This is the source code I'm working on in order to learn more about Java and Minecraft modding. Unless you're looking to learn some of the basics of Minecraft modding, this project not likely to be beneficial. This code will potentially lay the foundation for a focused and more useful mod in the future.

Created for Minecraft version 1.15.2 using Forge version 31.1.0. I would highly recommend manually updating your mappings if you recently installed the Forge MDK as the mappings included with Forge are not the latest version of mappings.

I have not tested the mod with versions other that 1.15.2.
